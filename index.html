        <p>Hey Chlo, can you believe its already been 2 months??? it felt like just yesterday where we were at Rochester, with the candles and the kinder eggs listening to this very song. I truly felt like i was dreaming when you told me for the first time that you love me back.</p>

        <p>I rememeber the way you looked at the scenery, eyes sparkling with the lights of the city. Even with the absolutley breath taking view all I could focus on was how beautiful you looked in the moonlight. Chloe, I knew I loved you WAYYY before this moment but for the first time, I felt like it was worth gambling away my heart. I couldnt hold back how I felt anymore because I knew regardless of how vulnerable and hurt I might get. You are the only one I trust with my heart, my soul, my being.</p>

        <p>I rememeber the week you were having the worst period cramps and generally having trouble with your family. I remember feeling like shit because no matter what I did I always felt responsible for everything that was happening to you. You'd send me so many videos of the viral choclate covered strawberries. I looked at the save on next to the gym and couldnt find anything, so i went to a whole other store to get them for you. This was really the moment i realized, regardless of how small or big I would genuinely do anything for you, so long as I saw that beautiful smile.</p>

    <p>I remember the day both of us skipped school because of unrelated reasons. We managed to squeeze in those couple hours together. You had almost no homework and I had a massive assignment due that day with 0% done. I was lowkey stressing the fuck out, but then after seeing you it felt like everything was gonna be okay. Regardless of everything i still got that assignment in on time 3:15 on the dot. You genuinely brought me so much peace, I never told you this but it really took all the stress off of my shoulders.</p>

    <p>This video is by far one of my favourite. Doing something im so passionate about, while having you by my side. It felt like a glimpse of the future I want to build for us. This week bitcoin went to the fucking moon, i invested quite abit prior and i took that money to buy you a 18k Gold necklace witrh pearls and opal stones. If i'm being honest it genuinely drived me crazy finding out i bought you something you wouldn't really like. I felt like I failed as a bf but to this day you still wear it constantly, knowing how much it means to me seeing it on you.</p>

    <p>I remember looking back to this video multiple times because i've genuinely never seen myself so happy before. You really make the world dissapear, you make everyday feel like a miracle, and you make me feel like its okay to be who I really am. I've never seen this side of me, but I love knowing this part of me is yours and yours alone.</p>

    <p>I remember this day like it was yesterday. It was after your Shuttle Sport Tournament, you seemed super down. I remember thinking how much it hurt seeing you hurt. So I did everything possible to show you how much I love you regardless. Our walk after the tournament was so bitter sweet. I finally got to see your dad, regardless of how he felt about it. Although my biggest take away was how beautiful you looked under all the Cherry blossoms and how bright that smile of yours was when I was actually there for you, cheering you on. I remember feeling so out of place, that I borderline didn't belong, but after seeing that HUGE smile. It was worth every single insecure feeling, every single hour spent watching, and every single weird look I got.  </p>

    <p>Charleson to me has always been MY SPOT. The spot I refused to expose to anybody except my closest friends. I remember telling you about just how breathtaking the views were and also feeling so sad that I couldn't show you it myself. The reason I so desperately wanted you to see it yourself was because, everytime I saw that view, it is but a meer fraction of how I feel when I look at you.</p>

    <p>By far, my favourite picture I have of you. I remeber doing some work on my computer and telling you about it, as I let the first work out of my mouth you immediately hushed me and said "SHHHH I'm in a meeting!" The way my heart practically jumped out of my body. Seeing you so comfortable, so innocent, so filled with child like joy. Genuinely made me think about just how perfect of a family we will make one day. Just how wonderful of a mother you'd make, playing with the squishmellows. It truly showed me a glimpse into our future, and I will do everything in my power to insure its properity and securityt.</p>

<h1>SKATING!!!</h1>

    <p>You were so hesitant on going skating at first. I remember you telling me about your bad history with figure skating and just how much you hated the ice all together because of it. When I heard those stories, I wanted to make it my goal to change your perspective and show you just how fun it can be with the right people. Hehe I remember lying to you about my ice skating skills because I wanted to surprise you. I never told you this, but seeing you so happy to skate with my, seeing that part of you get healed. It genuinely made me feel so proud of you for confronting that, but also just how impactful it was for me to see that I helped you overcome something so significant in your life.</p>
    
    <p>Chloe, I genuinely cannot express just how much you mean to me. There isn't an amount of money I could spend to describe your value. There isn't an amount of time, enough to show you just how much I genuinely love you. Regardless of good/bad days, you are the only constant in my life. You are the only thing in my life that I can never give up on. You are the only thing in my life worth fighting till my last breath for. When I say "I love you" I don't say it out of habit, I say it to remind you each and every hour, minute, second just how much you've impacted my life. I love you more than anything, HAPPY ANNIVERSARY and to many many many many more. After that first time I opened up to you about my childhood, my traumas, my struggles. I knew I could always count on you when the chips are down. I just hadn’t realised I couldn’t do without you when they were up. I’m a gambler. I always have been and I always will be. When you’re with me, my chips are always up. As long as I live, my promise to you, I am all in.</p>
